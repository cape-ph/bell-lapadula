    "This document outlines the application of the [Bell-LaPadula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell%E2%80%93LaPadula_model) model as a formal system for safeguarding the confidentiality of public health data stored in information systems. The model, rooted in state machines, serves as a mathematical framework to articulate a manditory access control (MAC) policy.  Originally developed as a formal method to study the security of US Department of Defense computer systems, the Bell-LaPadula model serves as the theoretical underpinning of nearly all MAC systems, including [Security Enhanced Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security-Enhanced_Linux) (SELinux).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Formalism\n",
    "\n",
    "We begin by describing notation and concepts. \n",
    "\n",
    "The information system involves multiple users working concurrently on shared data. To articulate the Mandatory Access Control (MAC) policy, each user and data component receives a set of **classification categories**.  A classification category is a label or tag that is used as an annotaion to enforce access control rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "Importantly, we do not assume the classification categories form an ordinal set, where classifications can be ordered in an increasing hiearchy of protection levels.  This differs from the orignal Bell-LaPaulda model, which used the US Department of Defense (DoD) classification system (`UNCLASSIFIED` < `CONFIDENTIAL` < `SECRET` < `TOP SECRET`).  In the DoD system, because the classification categories are ordered, it possible to talk of data having \"higher\" or \"lower\" classification level.  This is not always possible with a non-ordered system.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Subjects and Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "We introduce definitions rooted in Bell and LaPaulda's original approach.  A subject is defined by the following properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A subject $S_i$ is a computer process launched by a user or by another subject.\n",
    "* A subject's classification is the set $C(S_i) \\subseteq \\Omega$, where $\\Omega$ is the set of all classification categories.\n",
    "* Some subjects are trusted. A trusted subject is annotated with a star as $S_i^*$.\n",
    "\n",
    "An object is defined by the following properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "* An object $O_j$ is data such as a file or a field in a database.\n",
    "* An object's classification is the set $C(O_j) \\subseteq \\Omega$.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we say that a classification set $C_i$ is **lower** than another set $C_j$, we mean that $C_i \\subset C_j$.  Similarly if $C_i$ has a **higher** classification than $C_j$ then $C_i \\supset C_j$.  Classifications are equal if and only if $C_i = C_j$.  But notably if the two classifications are not subsets of each other, we cannot say that one is higher than the other, only that they are distinct classifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Security properties\n",
    "\n",
    "The MAC system enforces the following security properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **The simple property (no read up)**: A subject $S_i$ may read an object $O_j$ if and only if $C(S_i) \\supseteq C(O_j)$. Simply put, a subject can only read objects at the same or lower classification level.  This property is required so that subjects do not access information they are not authorized to.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **The $*$-property (no write down)**: An untrusted subject $S_i$ may write an object $O_j$ if and only if $C(S_i) \\subseteq C(O_j)$. Simply put, an untrusted subject can only write objects at the same or higher classification level.  This property is required so that subjects do not leak protected information to unprivliged channels.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **The trusted subject property**: A trusted subject $S_i^*$ is not subject to the $*$-property and may write to any object regardless of classification level. Trusted subjects are subjects that the system administrator has a high degree of confidence will not leak protected information to an unprivliged channel. Trusted subjects are needed in most useful MAC systems, as without them the access controls are too limiting to accomplish practical work.\n",
    "\n",
    "### An example with public health data\n",
    "\n",
    "To help make things less abstract, we will refer to an example case of a MAC policy for public health data.  In this example, we will assume we are working with a system that stores Personal Health Information (PHI), HIPAA data, and data protected by two separate data sharing agreements.  The set of all classification categories is\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "  \\Omega = \\{ \\texttt{PHI},\\: \\texttt{HIPAA},\\: \\texttt{DSA1},\\: \\texttt{DSA2} \\}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\texttt{DSA1}$ and $\\texttt{DSA2}$ are classification categories for the first and second data sharing agreements respectively.  Now suppose we are working documents with the classifications\n",

    "| $O_3$    | $\\{ \\texttt{HIPAA},\\: \\texttt{DSA2} \\}$ |\n",
    "\n",
    "From these definitions we can infer the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Document $O_1$ is at a lower classification than $O_2$ since $\\{ \\texttt{PHI} \\} \\subset \\{ \\texttt{PHI},\\: \\texttt{DSA1} \\}$.\n",
    "* Documents $O_2$ and $O_3$ are at different classifications since $C(O_2) \\neq C(O_3)$, but neither classiciation is higher than the other because $C(O_2) \\not\\subset C(O_3)$ and $C(O_2) \\not\\supset C(O_3)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let $S_1$ and $S_2^*$ denote two users with the following access levels\n",
